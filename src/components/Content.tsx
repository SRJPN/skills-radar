        <b>Expert</b>
        <br />
        Skills in which I have achieved a high level of proficiency and confidence. These are my go-to abilities for solving complex problems, and I leverage them effectively in real-world scenarios. I continuously refine and expand these skills, often mentoring others or setting best practices in these areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Growth</b>
        <br />
        Skills I am actively learning or refining. I am exploring these through projects, courses, or other deliberate efforts. I see strong potential in these areas to become part of my "Expert" ring with further practice and exposure.

      <p>
        <b>Explore</b>
        <br />
        Skills I’m interested in and eager to learn. These are areas I find valuable or exciting and plan to invest time in developing further.

      <p>
        <b>Pause</b>
        <br />
        Skills I’ve decided to set aside for now. They may have been useful in the past but are no longer a focus due to lack of interest, changes in career direction, or reduced demand. I avoid investing additional time in these unless a strong reason emerges.
